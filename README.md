## 📊 Netflix Content Strategy — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores Netflix's public dataset to uncover trends in content production and distribution.  
Through Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA), I analyzed growth trends, content types, genres, and release patterns.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand the growth trend and origin distribution of Netflix content
- Compare Movies vs TV Shows: ratio, trends, and duration
- Identify the most common genres and whether they differ between Movies and TV Shows
- Analyze release seasonality: are there holiday/summer peaks?
- Investigate the duration patterns for both Movies and TV Shows

## 📊 Key Findings & Visualizations
1. Netflix content grew rapidly from 2015 to 2019, with a noticeable drop in 2020 likely due to COVID-19 disruptions.
2. Movies dominate the library (~70%), but TV Shows have gradually increased since 2018.
3. Top genres: Children & Family, Romance, Dramas, Comedies, Crime.
4. Seasonal peaks are observed in summer and winter, aligning with global holiday seasons.
5. Most movies last 80–120 mins, while most TV Shows are single-season series.

Below are selected visualizations from the project.  
They summarize the main insights of Netflix content trends, type comparison, genre patterns, and duration analysis.
